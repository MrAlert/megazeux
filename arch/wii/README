BUILDING MEGAZEUX FOR WII

As of 2.82b, MegaZeux can be built for the Wii. You will need the devkitPPC
toolchain, libogc, libfat, and the following PPC libraries from portlibs:

  - zlib (PNG support only)
  - libpng (PNG support only)
  - tremor-lowmem (audio only)

Make sure DEVKITPRO and DEVKITPPC are both defined and valid, and use a
config.sh configure line such as:

./config.sh --platform wii --prefix $DEVKITPPC --enable-tremor \
            --disable-utils --enable-release --enable-meter

Then build with the command:

make package

This will create a "boot.dol" file which you should know how to launch.

PACKAGING

Use "make archive" to build a build/dist/wii/mzxgit-wii.zip file for
distribution.
