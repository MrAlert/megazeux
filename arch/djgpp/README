BUILDING MEGAZEUX FOR DOS

As of 2.83b?, MegaZeux can be built for DOS (again.) You will need the DJGPP
toolchain. You may also need the following libraries and tools installed:

   - zlib (zlib*b.zip)
   - libpng (png*b.zip)
   - libogg (audio only)
   - libvorbis (audio only)

To build libogg and libvorbis, or to run config.sh under DOS, you'll also want:

   - bash (bsh*b.zip)
   - fileutils (fil*b.zip)
   - sed (sed*b.zip)
   - textutils (txt*b.zip)
   - sh-utils (shl*b.zip)
   - grep (grep*b.zip)
   - diffutils (dif*b.zip)
   - awk (gwk*b.zip)

You will also need a copy of CWSDPMI.EXE in this directory for packaging.

Use a config.sh configure line such as:

./config.sh --platform djgpp --prefix /dev/env/DJDIR --enable-release \
            --enable-meter

PACKAGING

Use "make archive" to build a build/dist/djgpp/mzxgit-djgpp.zip file for
distribution.

NOTES

Building with DJGPP has only been tested with the DJGPP toolchain running under
DOSEMU, but presumably this should work with a cross-compiling toolchain as
well. In that case, you must set DJGPPBASE to the correct prefix.

DJGPP 2.0.3 does not implement snprintf(), so DJGPP 2.0.4 beta may be required
to build a safe version of MegaZeux.

"mkdir src/.build" and other such commands may fail during make under DOSEMU
(unless you installed fileutils.) If this happens, you will have to manually
create the needed directories.

Running make under Linux after building MegaZeux under DOSEMU will most likely
fail due to weird dependency tracking files. Set NODEPS=1 to ignore these files.
